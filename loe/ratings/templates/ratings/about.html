    <h3>Making Predictions</h3>
    <p>After creating an account, you'll be able to save your predictions for upcoming matches by checking the box on the right after moving the slider to your predicted outcome.</p>
    <p>The slider represents the range of probabilities for the outcome, with the center being 50/50, all the way to the right being 100% chance the right-side team wins, and vice-versa for the left-side team.</p>
    <h3>Analyst Rating (AR)</h3>
    <p>AR is a measure of how good your predictions are. AR rewards well-placed confidence, but punishes misplaced confidence heavily. <em>Adjusted AR</em> takes into account how experienced you are as an analyst, scaling up to eventually match your <em>Raw AR</em> as you make more and more predictions.</p>
    <p>Predicting a 50/50 tossup will always result in an AR of 50, where correct predictions can get up to 100 and incorrect predictions can go down to -100.</p>
    <h4>The Math</h4>
    <p>AR is derived directly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier Score</a>, which is a measure of accuracy for probabilistic predictions. The Brier score for a prediction is the squared error between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome, and AR is calculated by scaling brier score to a range of Â±100.</p>

    <h2 class="section_header">Elo Model</h2>
    <p>The Elo Rating System aims to accurately predict match outcomes by maintaining a rating for each team. The model using those ratings to derive probabilities for each match outcome, and then depending on the actual match result, the model updates its ratings for the teams. The implementation used here initializes teams with a rating of 1500 and uses the formula</p>
    <p> $$P(T_1) = \frac{1} {10^ {\frac{-(T_1 - T_2)} {400}} + 1}$$ </p>
