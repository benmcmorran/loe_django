    <h3>Making Predictions</h3>
    <p>After creating an account, you'll be able to save your predictions for upcoming matches by checking the box on the right after moving the slider, representing the range of probabilities for the outcome, to your predicted outcome. You can always change your prediction up until an hour before the match begins.</p>
    <p>New matches and match results are automatically updated, so be sure to check back frequently, especially during playoffs when matchups may not be set until a few days before the match happens!</p>
    <h3>Analyst Rating (AR)</h3>
    <p>AR is a measure of how good your predictions are. AR rewards well-placed confidence, but punishes misplaced confidence heavily. <em>Adjusted AR</em> takes into account how experienced you are as an analyst, scaling up to eventually match your <em>Raw AR</em> as you make more and more predictions.</p>
    <p>Predicting a 50/50 tossup will always result in an AR of 50, where correct predictions can get up to 100 and incorrect predictions can go down to -100.</p>
    <h4>The Math</h4>
    <p>AR is derived directly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier Score</a>, which is a measure of accuracy for probabilistic predictions. The Brier score for a prediction is the squared error between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome, and AR is calculated by scaling brier score to a range of Â±100. In the formulas below, AR is Analyst Rating, BS is Brier Score, N is the number of matches predicted, and XP is the analyst experience factor:</p>
    <p> $$Adjusted AR = (100 - 200BS) * XP $$ </p>
    <p> $$BS = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N (p_t - o_t)^2$$ </p>
    <p> $$XP = min\left(3 , \frac{1}{3} log_{10} (N)\right)$$ </p>

    <h2 class="section_header">Elo Model</h2>
    <p>The Elo Rating System aims to accurately predict match outcomes by maintaining a rating for each team. The model uses those ratings to derive probabilities for each match outcome, and then depending on the actual match result, the model updates its ratings for the teams.</p>
    <p>The implementation used here initializes teams with a rating of 1500 and uses the following formula to predict match outcome, using Team 1's rating \(T_1\) and Team 2's rating \(T_2\).</p>
    <p> $$ P(T_1) = \frac{1} {10^ {\frac{-(T_1 - T_2)} {400}} + 1} $$ </p>
    <p>The prediction is expressed as a probability that one team beats the other, with the opposite being true for the other team in the match. After the match concludes, the model will calculate an adjustment value that winning team gains to its rating while the losing team loses to its. The adjustment value is calculated as:
    $$ Adj = KM(1-P(T_W)) $$
    where \(K\) is a fixed parameter in the model, \(M\) is the match score adjustment, and \(T_W\) is the winning team.</p>
    <p>One other implementation detail here is between seasons, every team's rating regresses 25% toward the regional mean to adjust for any changes in roster, meta, coaching, etc. It also tells the model that there is more uncertainty at the beginning of each new season.</p>
